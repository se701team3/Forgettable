# Forgettable

Welcome to the Forgettable project, created by SOFTENG 701 Team 3 students (Team Forgettable) from The University of Auckland.

## Introduction

Have you ever had the feeling, when you meet someone for the second time, you don’t remember anything about them? That’s where Forgettable comes in, Forgettable helps you forget how to forget.

Our project involves creating a web app that allows users to record the encounters and interactions they have made with other people, so in the future, users can look at their previous encounters to get an idea of the person they are meeting, and therefore, not forget who that person they are meeting is.

This makes encounters between people smoother and more engaging, while also helping you to remember people better and in greater detail.
